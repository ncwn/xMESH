# Gateway-Aware Cost Routing - Testing Plan

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Features ✅

1. **Multi-Factor Cost Function**
   - Formula: `cost = W1×hops + W2×normalize(RSSI) + W3×normalize(SNR) + W4×ETX + W5×gateway_bias`
   - Weights: W1=1.0, W2=0.3, W3=0.2, W4=0.4, W5=1.0
   - RSSI normalization: [-120,-30] dBm → [0,1]
   - SNR normalization: [-20,+10] dB → [0,1]
   - ETX calculation: 1/delivery_ratio over 20-packet windows
   - Gateway bias: (load - avg_load) / avg_load

2. **Link Quality Tracking**
   - Tracks up to 10 neighbors with LinkMetrics structure
   - RSSI estimation from SNR: `RSSI ≈ -120 + SNR×3`
   - SNR directly from RouteNode.receivedSNR
   - Exponential moving average smoothing (alpha=0.3)
   - Last update timestamps for staleness detection

3. **Periodic Route Re-evaluation**
   - `evaluateRoutingTableCosts()` runs every 10 seconds
   - Compares current route cost with alternatives
   - Applies 15% hysteresis threshold to prevent flapping
   - Updates routing table when significantly better path found

4. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Routing table now displays calculated cost for each route
   - Link quality metrics table (RSSI, SNR, ETX per neighbor)
   - Cost-based route update notifications
   - 30-second periodic status dumps

## Testing Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Verify cost calculation functions work correctly
2. Confirm link quality metrics are tracked accurately
3. Demonstrate route selection considers multiple factors (not just hops)
4. Compare routing behavior with hop-count baseline

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Firmware compiles for all 3 roles (sensor/router/gateway)
- ✅ Link metrics logging appears in serial output
- ✅ Cost values calculated and displayed in routing table
- ✅ Route updates triggered by cost evaluation (not just hop-count changes)

## Test Topology

### Topology A: Linear Chain (Baseline Comparison)
```
[Sensor] ←--→ [Router] ←--→ [Gateway]
  Node 1        Node 2         Node 3
```

**Purpose:** Compare with hop-count baseline from Week 2-3

**Expected Behavior:**
- Single path: Sensor → Router → Gateway (2 hops)
- Cost should reflect link quality differences
- If Router-Gateway link degrades, cost increases
- Display shows "GW-COST" protocol instead of "HOP-CNT"

### Topology B: Multiple Paths (Cost-Based Selection)
```
          [Router A] ──→ [Gateway]
         /                   |
[Sensor]                     |
         \                   |
          [Router B] ──→ [Gateway]
```

**Purpose:** Test route selection based on cost vs. hop-count only

**Expected Behavior:**
- Both paths have 2 hops (equal hop-count)
- Cost function should prefer path with better link quality
- If Router A has better RSSI/SNR, cost should be lower
- Route evaluation should switch paths if quality changes significantly

## Testing Procedure

### Phase 1: Compilation Verification ✅ (DONE)
```bash
cd firmware/3_gateway_routing
pio run -e sensor    # ✅ SUCCESS - 399,561 bytes
pio run -e router    # ✅ SUCCESS - 398,861 bytes
pio run -e gateway   # ✅ SUCCESS
```

### Phase 2: Serial Monitor Verification (NEXT)

#### Upload Firmware
```bash
# Sensor node
pio run -e sensor -t upload -t monitor

# Router node (separate terminal)
pio run -e router -t upload -t monitor

# Gateway node (separate terminal)
pio run -e gateway -t upload -t monitor
```

#### Expected Serial Output

**Sensor Node:**
```
xMESH Gateway-Aware Cost Routing - SENSOR
Local Address: 0xABCD
Waiting for routing table...

==== Routing Table (with Cost Metrics) ====
Addr   Via    Hops  Role  Cost
------|------|------|------|------
1234 | 5678 |    1 | 02 | 1.45
9ABC | 5678 |    2 | 01 | 2.73

==== Link Quality Metrics ====
Addr   RSSI   SNR   ETX
------|------|------|------
5678 | -85  |  8  | 1.20
```

**Key Observations:**
1. Cost column appears in routing table
2. Link quality metrics table populated
3. "Link quality: SNR=X dB, Est.RSSI=Y dBm" messages when receiving packets
4. "Cost-based route update" messages if routes change due to quality

### Phase 3: Functional Testing

#### Test Case 1: Cost Metric Tracking
**Setup:** Deploy 3 nodes in linear topology
**Action:** Monitor serial output for 5 minutes
**Verify:**
- [ ] Link metrics table populates with neighbor data
- [ ] RSSI/SNR values update as packets received
- [ ] ETX tracking shows transmission reliability
- [ ] Cost values calculated and logged

#### Test Case 2: Route Stability (Hysteresis)
**Setup:** 3 nodes with stable links
**Action:** Observe routing table for 10 minutes
**Verify:**
- [ ] Routes remain stable (no flapping)
- [ ] Cost evaluation runs every 10 seconds
- [ ] No unnecessary route updates

#### Test Case 3: Link Quality Impact
**Setup:** 3 nodes, introduce interference/distance change
**Action:** Move router node to degrade link quality
**Expected:**
- [ ] SNR/RSSI metrics decrease
- [ ] Cost increases for affected route
- [ ] Route update triggered if cost exceeds 15% threshold
- [ ] Serial message: "Cost-based route update: Dest XXXX: via YYYY→ZZZZ, cost A→B"

#### Test Case 4: Comparison with Hop-Count Baseline
**Setup:** Same topology as Week 2-3 testing
**Action:** Compare routing behavior
**Verify:**
- [ ] Packet delivery ratio similar or better
- [ ] Route selection more intelligent (considers quality, not just hops)
- [ ] Display shows "GW-COST" vs "HOP-CNT"

## Metrics to Collect

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR):** (rxCount at gateway) / (txCount at sensor)
- **Average Latency:** Time from sensor TX to gateway RX
- **Route Changes:** Number of cost-based route updates
- **Link Quality Range:** Min/max RSSI and SNR observed

### Qualitative Observations
- Route selection behavior vs hop-count baseline
- Cost function responsiveness to link quality changes
- Hysteresis effectiveness (prevents flapping?)
- Serial logging clarity and usefulness

## Known Limitations

1. **RSSI Estimation:** Using `RSSI ≈ -120 + SNR×3` approximation
   - Not as accurate as direct RSSI measurement
   - Sufficient for proof-of-concept demonstration
   - Future: Modify LoRaMesher to expose RSSI to AppPacket

2. **ETX Tracking:** Requires ACK mechanism
   - Currently simplified (tracks sent packets only)
   - Future: Integrate with LoRaMesher's ACK system
   - For now, ETX defaults to 1.5 and updates based on routing table persistence

3. **Gateway Bias:** Requires gateway discovery
   - Function implemented but not fully integrated
   - Needs multi-gateway testing scenario
   - Current single-gateway test won't demonstrate load balancing

4. **Route Evaluation Simplification:**
   - Currently assumes alternative routes have same hop count
   - Doesn't query neighbors for their routes to destination
   - Works for proof-of-concept, production needs more sophisticated logic

## Next Steps After Testing

### If Tests Pass:
1. Document test results in this file
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with Week 4-5 completion
3. Update AI_HANDOFF.md with implementation notes
