This figure provides a detailed, technical example of how the routing tables might look with the proposed gateway-aware cost metric. It shows that nodes calculate a composite ``GatewayCost'' to prioritize more reliable paths towards the designated gateway nodes (N2 and N8), demonstrating a deeper level of planning for the protocol's implementation. The cost calculation incorporates hop count, link quality (RSSI/SNR), ETX, and gateway-bias components.
