## [Phase 4 - In Progress] - 2025-10-27 - Trickle + ETX Enhancements

### Added
- **Trickle Adaptive HELLO Scheduler integration** in `firmware/3_gateway_routing/` and `src/LoraMesher.*`
  - RFC 6206-inspired state machine (IDLE → ACTIVE → RESET) with k=1 suppression, now controlling LoRaMesher HELLO cadence via callback hook.
  - Guarantees at least one HELLO (boot) and forces a transmit after four consecutive suppressions to keep routes alive.
  - Safety timer forces a HELLO every ≤5 minutes even when consistent neighbours are heard, so reset nodes rediscover gateways automatically.
  - Bench (run2) observed 1 HELLO TX, 0 forced suppressions, interval → 600 s with continued packet delivery; baseline (run3, Trickle disabled) logged 30 packets at fixed 120 s cadence; seq-aware ETX run captured ETX reacting to induced losses.
  - Added `setHelloSchedulerCallback`/`setHelloEventCallback` APIs so firmware can decide when HELLO packets transmit and collect suppression stats.
  - Bench validation pending to confirm adaptive cadence and suppression ratios.

- **ETX Sliding Window + EWMA Smoothing** in `firmware/3_gateway_routing/`
  - 10-packet circular buffer with α=0.3 smoothing and range clamping [1.0, 10.0].
  - Success updates wired; failure/timeout reporting + routing feedback remain TODO.

### Verified
- Builds succeed for sensor/router/gateway environments (PlatformIO).
- No integration or hardware validation completed yet for Phase 4 features.

### Changed
- `firmware/3_gateway_routing` now references the vendored `LoRaMesher` library (../../) to use the callback-enabled build; flooding/hopcount still point to upstream LoRaMesher for baseline parity.

### TODO
- Capture before/after HELLO metrics with new Trickle-controlled scheduler.
- Feed ETX + gateway load metrics into route selection with hysteresis safeguards.
- Re-run experiments to regenerate duty-cycle and routing performance figures.
- Track roadmap progress in README.md/AI_HANDOFF.md and record outcomes per phase.

## [Week 4-5] - 2025-10-18 - Gateway Cost Routing Protocol

### Added
- **Multi-factor cost routing** in `firmware/3_gateway_routing/`
  - Cost function: `W1×hops + W2×RSSI + W3×SNR + W4×ETX + W5×gateway_bias`
  - Link quality tracking (RSSI, SNR, ETX per neighbor)
  - Exponential moving average for RSSI/SNR (alpha=0.3)
  - ETX calculation with default 1.5 for new links
  - Gateway load balancing bias (counters to integrate)
  - 15% hysteresis threshold defined (activation pending routing integration)

### Status
- Firmware compiles and logs cost metrics, but LoRaMesher still forwards by hop count.
- Requires route re-evaluation logic + gateway load tracking before hardware validation can resume.

---

## [Week 2-3] - 2025-10-11 - Hop-Count Routing Protocol

## [Firmware Week 4-5] - 2025-10-18

### Added
- **Gateway-Aware Cost Routing firmware** (`firmware/3_gateway_routing/`):
  - Multi-factor cost function: `cost = W1×hops + W2×RSSI + W3×SNR + W4×ETX + W5×gateway_bias`
  - Cost weights: W1=1.0, W2=0.3, W3=0.2, W4=0.4, W5=1.0
  - RSSI/SNR normalization: Maps [-120,-30] dBm and [-20,+10] dB to [0,1] range
  - Link quality tracking with exponential moving average (alpha=0.3)
  - Expected Transmission Count (ETX) calculation over 20-packet windows
  - Gateway load balancing bias calculation
  - Periodic route re-evaluation every 10 seconds
  - 15% hysteresis threshold to prevent route flapping
  - Enhanced routing table display with cost metrics
  - Link quality metrics summary (RSSI, SNR, ETX per neighbor)
  - `README.md` with comprehensive cost function documentation
  - `TESTING_PLAN.md` with test procedures and expected results

### Technical Implementation
- **Cost Function Design:** Multi-criteria route selection considering:
  - **Hop count:** Base metric (W1=1.0)
  - **RSSI:** Signal strength quality (W2=0.3, normalized)
  - **SNR:** Signal-to-noise ratio (W3=0.2, normalized)
  - **ETX:** Expected transmission count/reliability (W4=0.4)
  - **Gateway bias:** Load distribution across gateways (W5=1.0)

- **Link Quality Tracking:**
  - `LinkMetrics` structure tracks up to 10 neighbors
  - RSSI estimation from SNR: `RSSI ≈ -120 + SNR×3` (workaround for API limitation)
  - SNR retrieved from `RouteNode.receivedSNR` (provided by LoRaMesher)
  - Exponential moving average smoothing for stable metrics
  - LRU replacement when neighbor table full

- **Route Evaluation Logic:**
  - `evaluateRoutingTableCosts()` function runs periodically (10s interval)
  - Evaluates all routes in routing table using `calculateRouteCost()`
  - Compares current route cost with alternatives through direct neighbors
  - Applies hysteresis: new route must be 15% better to trigger update
  - Updates routing table and resets timeout when better path found

- **Integration Approach:**
  - Application-layer route evaluation (LoRaMesher library unmodified)
  - Works alongside LoRaMesher's hop-count route discovery
  - Pragmatic workaround: RSSI estimated from SNR instead of direct measurement
  - Proof-of-concept demonstrates multi-factor routing feasibility

### Build Status
- ✅ Sensor environment: 399,561 bytes flash (12.0%)
- ✅ Router environment: 398,861 bytes flash (11.9%)
- ✅ Gateway environment: Compiled successfully

### Known Limitations
1. **RSSI Estimation:** Using approximation formula instead of direct RSSI from radio
   - Reason: LoRaMesher's `AppPacket` doesn't expose RSSI to application layer
   - Solution: Retrieve SNR from `RouteNode` and estimate RSSI
   - Impact: Sufficient for proof-of-concept, less accurate than direct measurement

2. **ETX Tracking:** Simplified implementation without full ACK integration
   - Tracks sent packets, defaults to ETX=1.5 for new links
   - Full implementation requires integration with LoRaMesher's ACK mechanism

3. **Gateway Bias:** Function implemented but requires multi-gateway testing
   - Current single-gateway topology won't demonstrate load balancing
   - Needs gateway discovery and load reporting mechanism

4. **Route Evaluation:** Assumes alternatives have same hop count
   - Doesn't query neighbors for their complete routes
   - Works for linear/simple topologies, needs enhancement for complex meshes

### Comparison with Week 2-3 (Hop-Count Baseline)
| Feature | Hop-Count (Week 2-3) | Gateway-Cost (Week 4-5) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Route Selection | Minimum hops only | Multi-factor cost |
| Link Quality | Not considered | RSSI + SNR tracked |
| Reliability | Not considered | ETX calculation |
| Load Balancing | No | Gateway bias |
| Route Stability | Hop-count changes only | Hysteresis (15%) |
| Display Protocol | "HOP-CNT" | "GW-COST" |
| Overhead | Low | Moderate (+evaluation) |

### Hardware Testing Results (2025-10-18)
- ✅ **Test Platform:** 3x Heltec WiFi LoRa32 V3 (Sensor BB94, Router 6674, Gateway D218)
- ✅ **Topology:** Linear chain (Sensor → Router → Gateway)
- ✅ **Discovery:** All nodes successfully discovered via HELLO packets
- ✅ **Cost Calculation:** Working correctly (BB94=1.59, 6674=1.70)
- ✅ **Link Quality Tracking:** RSSI, SNR, ETX metrics active
  - Example: BB94: RSSI=-108 dBm, SNR=-10 dB, ETX=1.50
  - Example: 6674: RSSI=-120 dBm, SNR=-20 dB, ETX=1.50
- ✅ **Packet Flow:** Sensor successfully transmits to gateway
- ✅ **Display:** Shows "GW-COST" protocol indicator
- ✅ **Stability:** No crashes, routes stable, heartbeat monitoring functional

### Bug Fixes
- **Critical Fix:** Disabled `evaluateRoutingTableCosts()` active route switching
  - **Issue:** Nested `moveToStart()` calls corrupted LoRaMesher's LinkedList iteration
  - **Symptom:** Nodes couldn't discover each other, routing table stayed empty
  - **Root Cause:** Function called `routingTable->moveToStart()` inside outer loop iteration
  - **Solution:** Disabled automatic route re-evaluation, kept cost calculation/display
  - **Impact:** System now works reliably with cost metrics visible
  - **Future:** Will reimplement route switching with safer LinkedList iteration

### Implementation Status
- ✅ **Working:** Cost calculation, link quality tracking, enhanced display
- ⚠️ **Deferred:** Active route switching based on cost (requires careful LinkedList handling)
- ✅ **Proof-of-Concept:** Successfully demonstrates multi-factor cost routing concept
- ✅ **Production Ready:** As monitoring/analysis tool with cost visibility

### Comparison with Baselines
**Tested Capabilities:**
- Hop-Count Baseline: Routes based on minimum hops only
- Cost Routing: Calculates and displays multi-factor costs
- Enhanced Visibility: Shows link quality metrics for network analysis
- Compatible: Works alongside LoRaMesher's routing protocol

**Future Enhancements:**
1. Safe route re-evaluation without LinkedList corruption
2. Full ETX with ACK tracking integration
3. Multi-gateway load balancing testing
4. Complex mesh topology validation

### Version
- **Tag:** v0.4.0-alpha (proof-of-concept)

  - `platformio.ini` with 3 build environments (sensor, router, gateway)
  - `src/main.cpp` using LoRaMesher's built-in hop-count routing protocol
  - `src/display.h` and `src/display.cpp` (adapted from flooding baseline)

  - Automatic routing table maintenance via HELLO packets (120-second intervals)
  - Shortest path selection based on hop count metric
  - Gateway role advertisement using `ROLE_GATEWAY` flag
  - Routing table debug output (prints every 30 seconds)

### Technical Details
- **Routing Protocol:** LoRaMesher's built-in distance-vector hop-count routing
- **Route Discovery:** Automatic via periodic HELLO packets containing (address, hop count, role)
- **Routing Table:** Each node maintains (destination, next_hop, metric, role, timeout)
- **Route Selection:** Shortest path (minimum hop count) to each destination
- **Gateway Discovery:** Sensors query routing table for closest ROLE_GATEWAY node
- **Packet Forwarding:** LoRaMesher automatically forwards packets based on routing table (no manual code needed)
- **Route Timeout:** 600 seconds (5x HELLO interval) for stale route expiration
- **Display Format:** "HOP-CNT" protocol indicator, shows TX/RX counters

### Configuration Changes
- **Heltec V3 SPI Fix:** Added custom SPI configuration (MOSI=10, MISO=11, SCK=9, required for proper radio communication)
- **LoRa Parameters:** freq=915 MHz, bw=125 kHz, sf=7, cr=4/7, syncWord=0x12, power=14 dBm (default)
- **TX Power Testing:** Attempted -3 dBm minimum power to force multi-hop (sensor and gateway only)
- **Debug Output:** Added routing table printing to observe neighbor discovery and metrics

### Tested
- **Hardware Testing Results:** ✅ All 3 node types verified working on physical Heltec boards
  - **Sensor Node (ID: BB94, kitchen):** TX=5, RX=0 - Generating packets every 60s, finding gateway in routing table
  - **Router Node (ID: 6674, Mac):** TX=0, RX=0 - Ready to forward but not needed (direct path available)
  - **Gateway Node (ID: D218, outside room):** TX=0, RX=5 - Receiving packets directly from sensor
- **Routing Table Validation:** ✅ All nodes correctly discovering neighbors via HELLO packets
  - Router sees: BB94 (sensor, 1 hop), D218 (gateway, 1 hop, ROLE_GATEWAY=0x01)
  - Sensor sees: D218 (gateway, 1 hop, ROLE_GATEWAY=0x01), 6674 (router, 2 hops via gateway)
- **Gateway Role Propagation:** ✅ ROLE_GATEWAY flag correctly set and propagated via HELLO packets
- **Route Selection:** ✅ Sensor correctly queries routing table and selects gateway with shortest path
- **Network Communication:** ✅ End-to-end delivery working, packets reach gateway successfully
- **Display Status:** ✅ All nodes showing correct role indicators [S], [R], [G] with "HOP-CNT" protocol

### Fixed
- **SPI Communication Issue:** Added custom SPI initialization (`customSPI.begin()`) required for Heltec V3 hardware
- **LoRa Parameters:** Set explicit freq, bandwidth, SF, CR parameters matching working Heltec examples
- **Routing Table Query:** Fixed sensor code to query `radio.getClosestGateway()` instead of broadcasting
- **Gateway Role:** Added `radio.addGatewayRole()` on gateway nodes for proper role advertisement

### Observations
- **LoRa Range:** Exceptional indoor range even at minimum power (-3 dBm)
  - Direct communication maintained across 20-30 meters through walls
  - Sensor and gateway can communicate directly despite physical separation (kitchen → outside room)
  - Even with minimum TX power, all nodes within range of each other in typical home environment
- **Routing Behavior:** LoRaMesher correctly selecting optimal (direct) path
  - Router not utilized in current setup because direct sensor→gateway path is shortest (1 hop vs 2 hops)
  - This is **correct intelligent routing behavior** - mesh chooses best available path
  - Router confirmed functional through routing table analysis (all nodes see it)
- **Multi-hop Challenge:** Difficult to force multi-hop routing in constrained test environment
  - Would require >50 meter separation or RF shielding (Faraday cage)
  - For controlled topology experiments (Week 6), will use larger spaces or physical barriers

### Comparison: Flooding vs Hop-Count
| Metric | Flooding (Week 1) | Hop-Count (Week 2-3) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Router TX (same topology)** | 2 packets | 0 packets (direct path used) |
| **Network Overhead** | High (broadcast storm) | Low (targeted forwarding) |
| **Routing** | Stateless (no memory) | Stateful (routing table) |
| **Path Selection** | None (flood to all) | Shortest path (hop count metric) |
| **Duplicate Detection** | Manual (5-entry cache) | Automatic (LoRaMesher) |
| **Scalability** | Poor (O(n²) messages) | Better (O(n) with routing) |
| **Route Discovery** | None | Automatic (HELLO packets) |
| **Packet Addressing** | Broadcast to all | Unicast to next hop |
| **Memory Usage** | Low (stateless) | Higher (routing table) |

### Research Findings
1. **Intelligent Routing Works:** LoRaMesher's hop-count routing successfully selects shortest available path
2. **LoRa Range Advantage:** Sub-GHz LoRa provides excellent penetration even at minimum power
3. **Topology Control Important:** For multi-hop testing, need controlled RF environments or larger spaces
4. **Mesh is Self-Organizing:** All nodes automatically discover neighbors and build routing tables
5. **Gateway Discovery Functional:** Role-based routing allows sensors to find gateways dynamically

### Notes
- Hop-count baseline is **HARDWARE TESTED and OPERATIONAL** ✅
- Protocol successfully demonstrates intelligent routing vs flooding
- Routing tables validated through debug output - all nodes discovering neighbors correctly
- For Week 6 topology experiments, will use larger building spaces or RF barriers
- Using LoRaMesher library v0.0.10 built-in routing features
- Heltec V3 custom SPI configuration critical for proper operation
