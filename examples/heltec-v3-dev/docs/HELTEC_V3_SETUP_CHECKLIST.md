- [ ] USB-C cable (data cable, not charge-only)
- [ ] Computer with USB port

### Software
- [ ] Visual Studio Code installed
- [ ] PlatformIO extension installed in VS Code
- [ ] CP210x USB driver installed (if needed)

## ‚òëÔ∏è Hardware Setup Checklist

### Physical Connections
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Antenna connected to the board
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER power on without antenna - can damage RF amplifier!
- [ ] USB-C cable connected to board
- [ ] USB cable connected to computer
- [ ] Board powers on (small power LED lights up)

### Verification
- [ ] Board is detected by computer
  - macOS: Check in "System Information" ‚Üí USB
  - Windows: Check in "Device Manager" ‚Üí Ports
  - Linux: Run `ls /dev/ttyUSB*` or `ls /dev/ttyACM*`

## ‚òëÔ∏è Software Setup Checklist

### Project Setup
- [ ] Cloned/downloaded the Heltec-V3 branch
- [ ] Opened example project in VS Code (`examples/HeltecV3` or `examples/HeltecV3-Display`)
- [ ] PlatformIO recognizes the project (shows in PlatformIO tab)

### Configuration Verification
- [ ] `platformio.ini` has correct board: `heltec_wifi_lora_32_V3`
- [ ] Frequency set correctly for your region (in `main.cpp`):
  - [ ] 868.0 MHz for Europe
  - [ ] 915.0 MHz for North America
  - [ ] 433.0 MHz for Asia
- [ ] All pin definitions match:
  ```cpp
  LORA_CS   = 8
  LORA_IRQ  = 14
  LORA_RST  = 12
  LORA_IO1  = 14
  LORA_MOSI = 10
  LORA_MISO = 11
  LORA_SCK  = 9
  ```

## ‚òëÔ∏è First Build Checklist

### Building
- [ ] Click "Build" in PlatformIO (checkmark icon)
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] If build fails, check:
  - [ ] All dependencies installed (RadioLib, Adafruit libraries if using display)
  - [ ] No syntax errors in code
  - [ ] Correct framework selected (Arduino)

### Uploading
- [ ] Select correct serial port in PlatformIO
- [ ] Click "Upload" (arrow icon)
- [ ] If upload fails:
  - [ ] Try holding "PRG" button while uploading
  - [ ] Check USB cable is data cable
  - [ ] Verify drivers are installed
  - [ ] Try different USB port

### First Run
- [ ] Upload completes successfully
- [ ] Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud)
- [ ] See initialization messages:
  - [ ] "Initializing LoRaMesher for Heltec LoRa 32 V3..."
  - [ ] "LoRaMesher initialized successfully!"
  - [ ] Local address displayed (e.g., "Local address: 0xABCD")
- [ ] LED flashes on boot (2 quick flashes)
- [ ] If using display example:
  - [ ] OLED screen turns on
  - [ ] Text appears on display

## ‚òëÔ∏è Functionality Checklist

### Basic Operation
- [ ] Board sends packets periodically (check serial output)
- [ ] LED blinks when sending
- [ ] Packet counter increments
- [ ] No error messages in serial monitor

### Display (if using HeltecV3-Display)
- [ ] Display shows local address
- [ ] Display updates with TX counter
- [ ] Display shows routing table info
- [ ] Text scrolls if too long

### Two-Board Testing (if available)
- [ ] Both boards use same configuration:
  - [ ] Same frequency
  - [ ] Same spreading factor (SF)
  - [ ] Same bandwidth (BW)
  - [ ] Same coding rate (CR)
  - [ ] Same sync word
- [ ] Board 1 receives packets from Board 2
- [ ] Board 2 receives packets from Board 1
- [ ] LED blinks on both boards when receiving
- [ ] Serial monitor shows received packets on both
- [ ] Routing table builds on both boards

## ‚òëÔ∏è Performance Checklist

### Signal Quality
- [ ] Monitor RSSI values (should be > -120 dBm for good link)
- [ ] Monitor SNR values (should be > 0 dB for good link)
- [ ] Check for packet loss (compare sent vs received)

### Range Testing (optional)
- [ ] Test at close range (1-2 meters) - should work perfectly
- [ ] Test at medium range (10-50 meters)
- [ ] Test at longer range (up to several km in open areas)
- [ ] Note performance at different spreading factors

## ‚òëÔ∏è Troubleshooting Checklist

### If No Communication
- [ ] Verify antenna is connected
- [ ] Check frequency matches region and hardware
- [ ] Ensure both nodes have matching LoRa parameters
- [ ] Verify SPI pins are correct
- [ ] Check for error messages in serial output
- [ ] Try moving boards closer together
- [ ] Reduce spreading factor (try SF7)

### If Display Not Working
- [ ] Verify I2C address (0x3C)
- [ ] Check SDA (17) and SCL (18) pin definitions
- [ ] Confirm display libraries installed
- [ ] Try I2C scanner sketch to detect display
- [ ] Check OLED_RST pin (21)

### If Upload Fails
- [ ] Install/update CP210x drivers
- [ ] Hold "PRG" button during upload
- [ ] Try different USB cable
- [ ] Check serial port permissions (Linux/macOS)
- [ ] Reduce upload speed to 115200

### If High Power Consumption
- [ ] Control VEXT pin (GPIO 36) to power off display
- [ ] Implement sleep modes
- [ ] Reduce TX power if range permits
- [ ] Increase time between transmissions

## ‚òëÔ∏è Final Verification

- [ ] ‚úÖ Board uploads successfully
- [ ] ‚úÖ Serial monitor shows initialization
- [ ] ‚úÖ Packets are being sent
- [ ] ‚úÖ LED blinks appropriately
- [ ] ‚úÖ Display works (if using display example)
